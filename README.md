Java development and progression

Hello!

I'm starting to learn how to use GIT and will hopefully have some of my code up soon. Don't worry, it's nothing spectatular, but even if it's simplistic, I want to have a dedicated place to showcase my progression. I've been self-teaching many languages such as, Java, Javascript, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS over the past 4 years, while also completing my chemical engineering degree and working as a process engineer. As for myself, I have a passion for developing/sharpening my skills and hope to one day work as a software designer.

Any tips, collaboration, or helpful hints are very welcomed and much appreciated!  

:)
